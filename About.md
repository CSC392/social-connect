# About Social Connect

Thank you for playing with us! </h2>

Social Connect was developed as a project as part of the University of Toronto Mississauga’s Developer Student Community Projects in Fall of 2020.

## The Problem

Keeping in touch with friends and family when apart was and still is a prevalent issue in many people’s lives. The ongoing social distancing regulations as part of a nationwide measure to stop the spread of COVID-19 has only served to amplify the difficulty in connecting with others that many people have. As a result, feelings of isolation and loneliness have garnered in many people. The few existing browser based gaming platforms, such as MSN gGames and Yahoo Games are outdated visually unappealing, and are reliant on now obscure softwares such as Flash Player.

## The Solution

This empty market birthed our solution; a platform that allows users to play games online with friends and/or strangers as they so choose. Solving this issue of social connectivity involves populating the empty browser gaming market, which requires that our solution avoids the pitfalls of previous competitors in this virtual space. Thus, to combat feelings of isolation, our project is a web-based platform and interface which players can play games on while connecting with either their friends, family, or random users from around the world who just want to connect, interact and play! To circumvent the issues that the few remaining browser-based platforms such as MSN Games have ー issues which prevent these platforms from solving our main problem, our platform includes a chat feature of player interaction, does not require outdated extensions like Adobe Flash Player, is accessible on multiple platforms to facilitate a greater audience, and features turn-based non-real-time games to prevent lag.

## Social Connect - The best place to stay connected!
