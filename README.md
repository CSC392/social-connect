# social-connect
This is a project developed as part of DSC Community Projects in Fall 2020. 

# Problem Statement: 
Prior to the social distancing regulations, the issue of keeping in touch with friends and family from a long distance is and was prevalent in many peoplesâ€™ lives. The ongoing social distancing restrictions have only served to amplify that difficulty in connecting, and have garnered a feeling of isolation and loneliness in many people. The few existing browser based gaming platforms, such as MSN games and Yahoo games, are outdated, visually unappealing, and are reliant on now obscure softwares such as flash player. This empty market birthed our idea for this project, in which we will build a platform that will allow users to play games online with friends and strangers if they so choose.


# Proposed Solution:

Solving this social connectivity problem involves populating the empty browser gaming market, which requires that our solution avoids the pitfalls of previous competitors in this virtual space. Thus, to combat feelings of isolation, our solution will be a web interface which users can play games on and connect with either their friends, family, or random users from around the world who just want interaction. To circumvent the issues that the few remaining browser-based platforms such as MSN games have - issues which prevent these platforms from solving our main problem - our platform will include a chat function for player interaction, will not require Adobe Flash Player (which is outdated and now virtually unusable on Apple devices in particular), will be accessible on multiple platforms to facilitate a greater audience, and to prevent lag, will have at least 2 turn-based non-real time games.
